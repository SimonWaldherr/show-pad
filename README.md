ShowPad
=======

A realtime web application written in node.js whose aim it is to replace
the current etherpad-solution and provide a perfect enviroment to write
shownotes for various podcasts.

At the moment there is just a very basic auth-system and a textfield
synced in realtime by [ShareJS](http://sharejs.org/), this project also
makes use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [jQuery-queryParser](https://github.com/mattsnider/jquery-plugin-query-parser) and many others.
